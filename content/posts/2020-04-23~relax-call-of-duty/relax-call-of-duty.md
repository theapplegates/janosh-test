We just recently got a 4K TV( I know, finally joining the rest of the world), so we decided to get a Playstation 4 Pro ( Yes, I know a new one is due to be announced in May, but we have no use for a Playstation 5 with what? 8K).

So, I have always enjoyed the Call of Duty franchise. I find it relaxing to kill with no remorse. Don't judge me.
Mental note, I need to make these posts longer.
