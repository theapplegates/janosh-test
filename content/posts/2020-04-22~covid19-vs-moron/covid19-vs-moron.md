So this pandemic really is annoying. I'm talking about all the 20 somethings who don't care if they get the virus or not, plus the morons who want to end the stay at home orders before testing is in place.
Do you think I am going to want to go out when our moron of a President is encouraging the governors to open their states early? Thankfully most are listening to scientists and not our asshole President.

This is a test sentence.
